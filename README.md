# EDA-and-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
Overview

In an increasingly competitive retail market, understanding customer behavior and characteristics has become a critical factor for businesses aiming to optimize marketing strategies, enhance the shopping experience, and increase revenue. The EDA and Retail Customer Segmentation project focuses on analyzing retail data to uncover hidden behavioral patterns, identify groups of customers with similar characteristics, and support data-driven decision-making for businesses.

Problem Statement

Retail businesses possess large amounts of transactional and customer data, yet they often lack the tools and methods to transform this data into meaningful customer insights. Without proper customer segmentation, marketing campaigns become inefficient, advertising budgets are wasted, and revenue opportunities are not fully optimized. Therefore, the core problem is: How can we analyze, explore, and segment customers based on behavioral and transactional attributes to help businesses personalize marketing strategies and maximize profitability?

Project Objectives

This project aims to achieve the following key objectives:

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure of the dataset, identify missing values and outliers, and explore customer purchasing trends.

Engineer features from transactional data—such as RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)—to clearly describe customer behavior.

Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN to segment customers based on behavioral patterns.

Evaluate and interpret the segmentation results to generate actionable insights for personalized marketing, optimized promotional strategies, and improved customer retention.

Present findings through clear and intuitive visualizations to help businesses easily understand insights and make informed decisions.
